# Project-0---Simon-game-
<h1>The Simon Game</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Simon is a one player memory skills game. You have to press start, watch the number of flashes, and then repeat the pattern by clicking on the correct tiles all they way up to 20 or as far as you can go. </li>
  <li>I made this game because it was a challenge for me. </li>
  <h2>Technologies</h2>
  <li>For this project I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The HTML layed out the framework of the page allowing me to label everything with ID and classes.</li>
  <li>I used CSS to make all my shapes and position the page. Flex box was used to position the items on the page and relatively positioning allowed me to stack things ontop of eachother.</li>
  <h2>Installation Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>When the page loads, press start button</li>
  <li>The first box will flash, and the middle will say PLAY.</li>
  <li>once you click this first box, if correct, the middle will say watch again and watch the next pattern untill it completes.</li>
   <li>The pattern is a continous of the first pattern plus one more box.</li>
  <li>When the pattern completes, you have to re-input the entire pattern again starting from the beginnig each time.</li>
  <li>If you can remember the whole pattern up untill 20, then the middle will say WIN and you win the game with a high score of 20.</li>
  <li>If you miss click the pattern one time, the middle will say Game Over! and stop counting your score.</li>
  <li>If you get the High score it will show, if not you can still see your score.</li>
  <li>If you want to play again, click the Reset button.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Unsolved Problems</h2>
  <li>The buttons at the bottom of the page, are supposed to increase the speed of the game from the starting speed to faster or slower speeds, depending on how fast you want to play the game.</li>
